Fix PSR-2 spacing violations

This fixes three instances where there were minor spacing violations of
PSR-2. Specific rules are as follows:

>In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and
>there MUST be one space after each comma

This fix was applied to the AbstractCommand and OptionTest classes.

>There MUST NOT be trailing whitespace at the end of non-blank lines.

This fix was applied to the OptionFactory class.

>Closures MUST be declared with a space after the function keyword, and
>a space before and after the use keyword

This fix was applied to the tests/bootstrap.php file.

Remove trailing whitespace from docblock comments

Depending on how you define a "blank line" having trailing whitespace on
docblock comments is a violation of PSR-2.
