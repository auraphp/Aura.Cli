- [NEW] Add a SignalInterface and a bare-bones Signal implementation for
  handling hooks

- [NEW] Class StdioResource is now used in place of "naked" file handles;
  this allows easier lazy-loading of resources

- [NEW] Add a TranslatorInterface and a bare-bones Translator implementation
  for translating exception messages.

- [ADD] Exception classes now have method getMessageOnly(), and property
  $message_only, to determine if the exception should print only its message
  (as vs the entire stack trace).

- [NEW] Translation file intl/en_US.php for US English messages.

- In AbstractCommand ...

    - [ADD] Property $return, and methods setReturn() and getReturn(), to
      allow setting and getting of the return code from exec().
    
    - [ADD] Method init() and move init*() behaviors there.
    
    - [ADD] Method catchException(), along with adding a signal handler
      'catch_exception', to facilitate external exception handlers. The method
      sends "message-only" exception messages to stderr; other exceptions are
      re-thrown.
    
    - [ADD] Method getException() so that external handlers can read the
      thrown exception.
    
    - [ADD] Methods getReturn() and setReturn() so that external handlers can
      read and change the return code.
    
    - [CHG] The exec() method now uses try/catch and sends the
      'catch_exception' signal in the catch block.
    
    - [CHG] Getopt is now loaded, and params are now set, after the pre-exec
      hook executes in exec().

    - [CHG] In exec(), read and set the return code from the action return
      value.
    
    - [CHG] Allow the action() to take args from the getopt sequential params.
